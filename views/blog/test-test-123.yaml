content: And it feels amazing! In the past week I have cranked out two quality and what I think are sellable pieces, yay! I think I may have time for one more if the inspiration hits me by Saturday because that’s when I am finally going to Bellevue to get giclée prints done on a few pieces to get going on selling! I feel so blessed for all the support of friends and family towards my art soon-to-be career it just makes me feel motivated that my talent can actually be worth something.
