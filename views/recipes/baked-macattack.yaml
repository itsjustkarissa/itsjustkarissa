ingredients:
  - 4.5 x 8.5 inch glass baking dish
  - 2c pasta of choice (nice big shells or close relatives work great here)
  - 1.5tb vegan margarine
  - 1.5tb flour
  - 2c unsweetened non-dairy milk
  - 1tsp garlic powder
  - 1tb dried parsley
  - Pinch paprika
  - Few turns black pepper
  - 1/2c Daiya cheese shreds + 1/4c divided
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350Â°.
  - You know what to do in salted water 'til al dente, do not over cook!
  - While that's going, in a separate pot over medium heat add vegan margarine and flour, whisk like a maniac 'til it smells nutty (a minute or so).
  - Pour in unsweetened non-dairy milk, turning heat down to medium/low along with garlic powder, parsley, paprika, and black pepper.
  - Add 1/2c Daiya mixing regularly, turning the heat off once it gets to where you want it to be.
  - Drop and combine your al dente pasta right into the sauce pot. While they're having children, grease your glass baking dish.
  - Stopping midway to add the first half of the amount of Daiya you reserved, pour your concoction in the dish. 
  - Top with plain bread crumbs; sprinkle each of paprika, parsley, and pepper; topping it all off with the remaining reserved Daiya.
  - Pop in the oven for 30 minutes 'til it's beautiful. Cut in and grub! Don't burn your tongue.
