ingredients:
  - 1/2 raw cashews
  - 1/2&ndash;3/4c starchy pasta water reserves
  - 1tsp fresh lemon juice
  - 1&ndash;3 cloves fresh garlic
  - 1tb olive oil
  - 1tsp herbs of choice
steps:
  - Soak cashews in water for at least 24h in the fridge (the softer the cashews, creamier the sauce).
  - Get your pasta going in generously salted water, once done, reserve your pasta water, set aside.
  - Drain cashews and place in a blender along with lemon juice, garlic, hot pasta water, olive oil, and herbs of choice (I used kirkland organic no-salt seasoning), blend for a minute or two to emulsify.
  - Pour atop your pasta, garnish if you're feeling fancy, and serve it up!
